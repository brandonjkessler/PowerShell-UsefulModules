# Synopsis
Useful Modules for PowerShell

# Description
A collection of useful modules for powershell.
Each Module will  have a `.psm1` file that will then import all the functions from a `.ps1` file.
Functions available to users will be in the `Public` folder, however functions that are required by the module but not intended to be used on their own will be in the `Private` folder.
